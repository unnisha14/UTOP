As children, I am sure we have all played a lot of games with our friends: cricket, badminton, chess, etc. a long list. But there were some games we used to play in class which helped us to be awake in the boring classes. So, in my childhood, there was a game my friend circle used to play, namely DOTS & BOXES. And there was another game making me feel nostalgic for those old Nokia phones wherein the name of the game we had a snake going around to eat fruit.
So, I comprised both of them in my application and made one place for people to enjoy both.
First, let's talk about DOTS & BOXES, here we make a grid with dots a 4*4 or 5*5 grid where two players play their chances to get more squares to count. On giving chance to a player, he/she will draw a line from one point to another but before drawing two things are to be taken into consideration. First, no line is drawn there previously, and second, the line connects two-dot horizontally or vertically. Now, if after drawing one such line a unit square is formed then it is plus one for the player and he gets another chance to play.
Second is our cute snake going over the mobile screen as you keep feeding it the fruit it will grow bigger and bigger but if it touches the boundary or its body itself then you lost else keep growing your snake.
